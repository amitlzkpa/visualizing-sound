# Visualizing the Physics of Sound

This workshop will work through building a small application which will be used to visualize sound files in 3D.  
We will look at parsing audio using the WebAudioAPI and use threejs to visualize it on a browser. We will also look at how audio is stored and interpreted digitally and make representations of it in a 3D environment.
